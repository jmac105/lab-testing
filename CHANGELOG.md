# Changes

### 2.2.0

Fixed spelling error with the method name ```standardConstructorTest```. The existing ```standardContructorTest``` method will continue to work to avoid a breaking change but will ```console.warn``` you to change to the correct method. The mispelled method will be deprecated at the next major release.
